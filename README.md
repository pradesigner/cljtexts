# cljtexts

Various books or papers on or converted to clojure are kept here.

## Description

The clj files are of two types:

1. Run the code in the clojure books to understand the language better.
2. Convert other language (eg scheme, python) code to clojure thereby enabling the functionality of the code.
3. Explanations are sometimes provided by Perplexity or Chatgpt.

Here is a listing of what books we have here so far:

### Clojure-Cookbook
  by Luke VanderHart and Ryan Neufeld
  
  *The primary goal of this book is to provide mid-length examples of Clojure code that go beyond the basics, with a focus on real-world, everyday applications (as opposed to more conceptual or academic issues).*

### Clojure-Programming
by Chas Emerick, Brian Carper, and Christophe Grand

*Clojure offers a compelling practical alternative to many who strain against the limi-tations of typical programming languages and environments. We aim to demonstrate this by showing Clojure seamlessly interoperating with existing technologies, libraries, and services that many working programmers already use on a day-to-day basis. Throughout, weâ€™ll provide a solid grounding in Clojure fundamentals, starting from places of common expertise and familiarity rather than from (often foreign) computer science first principles.*

### Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman
with Julie Sussman

*This edition emphasizes several new themes. The most important of these is the central role played by different approaches to dealing with time in computational models: objects with state, concurrent programming, functional programming, lazy evaluation, and nondeterministic programming. We have included new sections on concurrency and nondeterminism, and we have tried to integrate this theme throughout the book.*
  

## Usage
Examine and execute forms in emacs. There is no purpose to running any of these files in entirity since they are just a collection of unrelated code.
